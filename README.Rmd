RUBer is an R package created for parameterized reporting according to the requirements at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum (RUB). So far, the package was primarily used for the eigth reporting cycle for teaching ([*Lehrberichterstattung*](http://www.uv.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/dezernat1/aufgaben/abteilung1/qmp/instrumente/inst_lehrberichterstattung.html)) in 2018-19. The package provides preconfigured ggplot2 plotting functions, custom themes for `ggplot2` and `flextable`, as well as functions making the RUB corporate design colors available. 

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RUBer")
```

## Guiding principles
1. Output format is Microsoft Word, so that generated reports remain editable by non-technical staff.
2. The generated reports adhere to the RUB corporate design and are ready for printing as is, with no further adjustments to layout or content required.
3. As far as possible, data manipulation and data analyis / visualization are treated as separate steps. All data manipulation is reproducible through documented functions and does not alter the source data. All calculated and derived data is saved to file. Thus, it can be proofread and altered by non-technical staff (who frequently have no knowledge of R) prior to the data analysis and reporting step.

## Package components
* Five preconfigured `ggplot2` plotting functions
* RUB `ggplot2` theme
* RUB `flextable` theme
* RUB Pandoc Word reference document
* RUB color palette
* Scale functions to make the RUB color palette available in `ggplot2`
* RMarkdown template that uses `knitr::knit_expand()` to dynamically create code chunks containing figures, captions and subcaptions 
* Fake data set that illustrates intended usage of the package
* Data manipulation functions specific to the 2018 dataset. These function are probably of no interest externally, as access to this dataset is confidential.

## Background
The University of Bochum regularly obtains survey data through the nationwide Graduate Survey Cooperation Project (KOAB) and through its participation in the joint educational initiative RuhrFutur. `RUBer` is used to dynamically generate reports visualizing this survey data in the RUB corporate design. The output format is Microsoft Word, so that the reports remain editable by staff with non-technical backgrounds.

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
## library(RUB)
## basic example code
```
