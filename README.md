RUBer is an R package created for parameterized reporting according to
the requirements at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum (RUB). So far, the
package was primarily used for the eigth reporting cycle for teaching
([*Lehrberichterstattung*](http://www.uv.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/dezernat1/aufgaben/abteilung1/qmp/instrumente/inst_lehrberichterstattung.html))
in 2018-19. The package provides preconfigured ggplot2 plotting
functions, custom themes for `ggplot2` and `flextable`, as well as
functions making the RUB corporate design colors available.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RUBer")
```

## Guiding principles

1.  Output format is Microsoft Word, so that generated reports remain
    editable by non-technical staff.
2.  The generated reports adhere to the RUB corporate design and are
    ready for printing as is, with no further adjustments to layout or
    content required.
3.  As far as possible, data manipulation and data analyis /
    visualization are treated as separate steps. All data manipulation
    is reproducible through documented functions and does not alter the
    source data. All calculated and derived data is saved to file. Thus,
    it can be proofread and altered by non-technical staff (who
    frequently have no knowledge of R) prior to the data analysis and
    reporting step.

## Package components

  - Five preconfigured `ggplot2` plotting functions
  - A custom `ggplot2` theme
  - A custom `flextable` theme
  - Word reference document for use with Pandoc and R Markdown
  - Functions for a RUB color palette
  - Scale functions to make the RUB color palette available in `ggplot2`
  - RMarkdown template that uses `knitr::knit_expand()` to dynamically
    create code chunks containing figures, captions and subcaptions
  - Fake data set that illustrates intended usage of the package
  - Data manipulation functions specific to the 2018 dataset. These
    function are probably of no interest externally, as access to this
    dataset is confidential

## Background

The University of Bochum regularly obtains survey data through the
nationwide Graduate Survey Cooperation Project (KOAB) and through its
participation in the joint educational initiative RuhrFutur. `RUBer` is
used to dynamically generate reports visualizing this survey data in the
RUB corporate design. The output format is Microsoft Word, so that the
reports remain editable by staff with non-technical backgrounds.

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## library(RUB)
## basic example code
```
